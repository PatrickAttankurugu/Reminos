## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project- Reminos is a reminder desktop application. It is intended to be able to check up the birthdays of the user's friends  on facebook and send a report to the user in the form of an sms.This report should contain the list of people who are celebrating their birthdays for the particular day and their contact details or email addresses. It should also be able to text a birthday wish to the celebrant in the form of an sms. In any case where the celebrant's number is not on facebook, the application should have the option to send them a birthday message by email.
### WHY THIS PROJECT?
The social media(e.g Facebook,Twitter) has been undeniably helpful to users.Some of the benefits include but not limited to :
* Connecting us with friends for the fun of it
* Helping us make new friends and 
* Helping us promote our businesses.

However, as humans,the neurons which are responsible for our learning cannot really grow when we are contantly distracted. New neurons are formed when we are able to do long period of focussed work. In as much as facebook and other social networking sites help us in a number of ways, they also prevent us from really mastering any skill. Not only that, according to neuroscience and human psychology, the human brain works by constantly doing comparism. So people leave facebook feeling down and worthless because their peers seem to be 'doing better than they'. Since humans are social animals, we have the desire to actually connect with our loved ones. I thought of building this application to help us celebrate the birthdays of our friends and loved ones whilst reducing the need to get glued to social media. Personally, I do not object to the use of social media. Neither am I subjective, I am only an evangelist against the excessive use of these social networking sites especially if they do not promote deep work. This is the reason I thought I should develop an app that can help people celebrate their birthdays without the excessive use of social media. If it is worth it, then please contribute to this project.

## GETTING STARTED

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
I used the chrome extension "Social birthday export" to export my facebook birthday calender into a CSV file.

This app is a start up application. What I mean by this is that, the app lauches and is always running whenever your system is on. You can turn this off by simply searching 'startup apps' on your desktop search bar. The startup app settings will appear. Click on this and turn it off. But this means that the program will not be able to send you notifications again until you turn it on.
